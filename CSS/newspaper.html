        <div class="newspaper">
            If you ever do design work for a news outlet such as magazine or newspaper, you will need to create a multi-column layout much like what you see in the actual pages of a magazine or newspaper. With CSS2, you would typically create such a layout using the float property. This can cause inconsistencies in display if there is a difference in how the browsers support the float property or the user resizes the window.  The CSS3 column module allows you to break up your page into columns using the column properties. When fully implemented, these columns will display consistently across all browsers. At the moment you will need to use browser specific prefixes, as not all browsers support the property.
